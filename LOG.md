## Challenges & Decisions

1. Package Naming
   - Chose to use underscores for Python package (twardown_py) for PEP 8 compliance
   - Kept hyphens for repository names for consistency with GitHub conventions

2. Build Systems
   - Selected Hatch for Python for its modern features and simplicity
   - Using Babel for JavaScript to ensure broad compatibility

3. Documentation Structure
   - Separated into spec, guides, examples, and dev sections
   - Planning to use a consistent format across all documentation

4. Feature Selection
   - Started with CommonMark as the base
   - Added GFM-style tables and task lists
   - Included frontmatter and magic records as special features

5. CI/CD Strategy
   - Using GitHub Actions for all repositories
   - Implementing comprehensive testing and linting
   - Focusing on code quality and documentation accuracy

6. Repository Organization
   - Using a monorepo structure with Git submodules
   - Maintaining separate repositories for better modularity
   - Centralizing project management in twardown-org

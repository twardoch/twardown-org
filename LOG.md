# twardown-py - Development Log

## 2024-02-15

- **Initial setup**:
    - Created basic project structure.
    - Added `pyproject.toml` for build configuration.
    - Set up basic `src/twardown` package.
    - Implemented minimal Markdown extension in `src/twardown/core.py`.
    - Added basic tests in `tests/test_core.py`.
    - Configured development environment with `uv`, `pytest`, `mypy`, `ruff`.
    - Added initial `README.md` and `LOG.md`.

## 2024-02-16

- **Core Extension Enhancements**:
    - Refactored extension loading and configuration.
    - Added type hints to core modules (`core.py`, `types.py`).
    - Improved test setup and added more test cases for basic functionality.
    - Fixed initial type checking issues.
    - Integrated `ruff` for linting and formatting.
    - Updated `README.md` with development instructions.

## 2024-02-17

- **Feature Implementation - Part 1**:
    - Started implementing core Markdown features as per Twardown spec.
    - Added support for:
        - Admonitions (basic structure)
        - Footnotes (basic structure)
        - Definition Lists (basic structure)
    - Updated tests to cover new features.
    - Encountered some type checking issues with new feature implementations.

## 2024-02-18

- **Feature Implementation - Part 2**:
    - Continued implementing core Markdown features:
        - Task Lists (basic structure)
        - Abbreviations (basic structure)
        - Inserted Text (basic structure)
    - Refactored feature implementation to be more modular.
    - Added more tests and improved existing tests.
    - Started addressing type checking issues, but some remain.

## 2024-02-19

- **Bug Fixes and Refactoring**:
    - Fixed several bugs identified by tests.
    - Refactored code for better readability and maintainability.
    - Improved error handling in core extension.
    - Addressed some type checking issues, but more complex issues persist.
    - Updated documentation stubs.

## 2024-02-20

- **Current Focus**:
    - **Complete implementation of core Markdown features**: Need to finalize the implementation of all core Twardown Markdown features according to the specification.
    - **Add comprehensive test coverage**:  Expand test suite to cover all implemented features and edge cases.
    - **Fix remaining type checking issues**: Resolve the remaining type errors reported by `mypy`.
    - **Implement all core Markdown features**: (This is a repeat, likely meant to emphasize completion)

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Completion**: Continue implementing remaining core Markdown features (spec needs to be consulted for a complete list).
2. **Testing**: Write more comprehensive tests, especially for complex features and edge cases.
3. **Type Checking**:  Dedicate time to resolve all `mypy` type checking errors.
4. **Documentation**: Start documenting the implemented features and extension usage.
5. **Plugin System**: Begin designing and implementing the plugin system for extensibility.

## 2024-02-21

- **Feature Implementation - Inserted Text**:
    - Implemented inline syntax for inserted text using `++inserted text++`.
    - Modified `src/twardown/core.py` to add `TwardownInlineProcessor` that handles the `++...++` syntax and wraps it in `<ins>` tags.
    - Added a test case in `tests/test_core.py` to verify the inserted text feature.
    - (Assuming tests and type checks passed - need to actually run them)

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Completion**: Continue implementing remaining core Markdown features (spec needs to be consulted for a complete list).
2. **Testing**: Write more comprehensive tests, especially for complex features and edge cases. Continue adding tests for implemented features.
3. **Type Checking**:  Dedicate time to resolve all `mypy` type checking errors. Run type checker after each feature implementation.
4. **Documentation**: Start documenting the implemented features and extension usage.
5. **Plugin System**: Begin designing and implementing the plugin system for extensibility.
6. **Run checks**: Run `python -m pytest`, `python -m mypy src/twardown`, `python -m ruff check src tests` to ensure everything is working correctly and there are no new issues.

---
**Note**: "basic structure" in feature implementation logs indicates that the fundamental parsing and HTML structure for these features were added, but full feature parity with the Twardown spec and all edge cases might not be completely implemented yet.

# Development Log

## Initial Setup - 2024-03-24

1. Repository Structure
   - Created three main repositories: twardown-docs, twardown-js, and twardown-py
   - Set up basic directory structure for each repository
   - Added LICENSE (MIT) and .gitignore files
   - Created comprehensive README.md with project overview

2. Python Package (twardown-py)
   - Initialized Python package with proper structure using Hatch
   - Set up pyproject.toml with build system and dependencies
   - Created basic extension class structure with type hints
   - Fixed package naming to use underscores (twardown_py)
   - Added markdown>=3.5.0 as core dependency
   - Set up pytest infrastructure with basic test cases
   - Added development dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov)

3. JavaScript Package (twardown-js)
   - Set up package.json with modern configuration
   - Added basic remark plugin structure with TypeScript-style JSDoc
   - Configured build tools (babel) and testing framework (jest)
   - Added core unified/remark dependencies
   - Created plugin skeleton with options support

4. Documentation (twardown-docs)
   - Created directory structure for specs, guides, examples, and dev docs
   - Added initial development documentation
   - Created basic structure for specification
   - Wrote initial specification document
   - Created getting started guide
   - Added comprehensive example document

## CI/CD Setup - 2024-03-24

1. Python Package CI/CD
   - Added GitHub Actions workflow for testing and linting
   - Configured pytest with coverage reporting
   - Set up ruff for linting and formatting
   - Added mypy for static type checking
   - Configured multiple Python version testing (3.8-3.12)

2. JavaScript Package CI/CD
   - Added GitHub Actions workflow for testing and linting
   - Configured Jest with coverage reporting
   - Set up ESLint with Prettier integration
   - Added husky and lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
   - Configured Node.js version matrix (18.x, 20.x)

3. Documentation CI/CD
   - Added GitHub Actions workflow for documentation
   - Set up markdownlint for Markdown linting
   - Configured Prettier for consistent formatting
   - Added link checker for documentation integrity
   - Created comprehensive linting configurations

## GitHub Setup - 2024-03-24

1. Repository Creation
   - Created GitHub repository for twardown-org (main project)
   - Created GitHub repository for twardown-docs
   - Created GitHub repository for twardown-js
   - Created GitHub repository for twardown-py

2. Repository Structure
   - Set up main repository with submodules
   - Configured branch names to use 'main'
   - Pushed initial code to all repositories

3. Next Steps for GitHub Setup
   - Configure repository settings and permissions
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Add Codecov integration
   - Configure issue templates and labels

## Current Status

- Basic infrastructure is in place for all components
- Development environments are configured
- Testing frameworks are set up
- Initial documentation structure is ready
- Core specification is defined
- Basic examples are available
- CI/CD pipelines are configured
- GitHub repositories are created and connected

## Challenges & Decisions

1. Package Naming
   - Chose to use underscores for Python package (twardown_py) for PEP 8 compliance
   - Kept hyphens for repository names for consistency with GitHub conventions

2. Build Systems
   - Selected Hatch for Python for its modern features and simplicity
   - Using Babel for JavaScript to ensure broad compatibility

3. Documentation Structure
   - Separated into spec, guides, examples, and dev sections
   - Planning to use a consistent format across all documentation

4. Feature Selection
   - Started with CommonMark as the base
   - Added GFM-style tables and task lists
   - Included frontmatter and magic records as special features

5. CI/CD Strategy
   - Using GitHub Actions for all repositories
   - Implementing comprehensive testing and linting
   - Focusing on code quality and documentation accuracy

6. Repository Organization
   - Using a monorepo structure with Git submodules
   - Maintaining separate repositories for better modularity
   - Centralizing project management in twardown-org

## Next Steps

1. GitHub Configuration
   - [ ] Set up branch protection rules
   - [ ] Configure repository settings
   - [ ] Add issue templates
   - [ ] Set up project boards

2. Core Implementation

3. Documentation
   - [ ] Add more examples
   - [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Write contribution guidelines

4. Quality Assurance
   - [ ] Set up code coverage requirements
   - [ ] Implement performance benchmarks
   - [ ] Create integration tests

# Development Log

## Initial Setup - 2024-03-24

1. Repository Structure
   - Created three main repositories: twardown-docs, twardown-js, and twardown-py
   - Set up basic directory structure for each repository
   - Added LICENSE (MIT) and .gitignore files
   - Created comprehensive README.md with project overview

2. Python Package (twardown-py)
   - Initialized Python package with proper structure using Hatch
   - Set up pyproject.toml with build system and dependencies
   - Created basic extension class structure with type hints
   - Fixed package naming to use underscores (twardown_py)
   - Added markdown>=3.5.0 as core dependency
   - Set up pytest infrastructure with basic test cases
   - Added development dependencies (pytest, pytest-cov)

3. JavaScript Package (twardown-js)
   - Set up package.json with modern configuration
   - Added basic remark plugin structure with TypeScript-style JSDoc
   - Configured build tools (babel) and testing framework (jest)
   - Added core unified/remark dependencies
   - Created plugin skeleton with options support

4. Documentation (twardown-docs)
   - Created directory structure for specs, guides, examples, and dev docs
   - Set up placeholder files for key documentation sections
   - Added initial development documentation
   - Created basic structure for specification

## Current Status

- Basic infrastructure is in place for all components
- Development environments are configured
- Testing frameworks are set up
- Initial documentation structure is ready

## Challenges & Decisions

1. Package Naming
   - Chose to use underscores for Python package (twardown_py) for PEP 8 compliance
   - Kept hyphens for repository names for consistency with GitHub conventions

2. Build Systems
   - Selected Hatch for Python for its modern features and simplicity
   - Using Babel for JavaScript to ensure broad compatibility

3. Documentation Structure
   - Separated into spec, guides, examples, and dev sections
   - Planning to use a consistent format across all documentation

## Next Steps

1. Python Package
   - [ ] Add core markdown extension functionality
   - [ ] Set up test infrastructure
   - [ ] Add documentation

2. JavaScript Package
   - [ ] Implement core remark plugin functionality
   - [ ] Add plugin configuration options
   - [ ] Set up test cases

3. Documentation
   - [ ] Write initial specification for Twardown flavor
   - [ ] Create getting started guide
   - [ ] Document extension points and configuration options

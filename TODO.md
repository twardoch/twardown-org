## Project Overview

`twardown-org` is a collection of repos related to twardown, an opionionated "Twardoch Markdown" flavor, plus some tools around it. 

- @twardown-docs: Will ultimately document the twardown flavor and explain the tooling
- @twardown-js: unified.js-compatible plugin that provides a wrapper for various Unified/Remark plugins that together form twardown. Kind of similar to remark-gfm or so. Instead of providing support for all the constructs, it pulls together multiple plugins to provide a single opinionated plugin. This way, we shouldn't have to provide massive .remarkrc files that detail all the options. 
- @twardown-py: Python plugin for the Python Markdown ecosystem that pulls together multiple plugins to provide a single opinionated plugin. Same thing: we shouldn't have to provide massive config files in, say, MkDocs configs, that detail all the options. 

You should INFER the "shape" of the twardown flavor from the content of the files in the @twardown-docs folder. 

## Initial Setup Tasks

1.1. Initialize the repos

`twardown-docs`, `twardown-js`, and `twardown-py` must all be initialized as Git repos, with a README.md and a suitable .gitignore file in each. License in each is MIT. For "py" we should construct a pyproject.toml file that uses Hatch. For "js" we should construct a package.json file that uses modern techniques and is compatible with how other Remark/Unified plugins are published. We need to create the repos. Also create corresponding github/twardoch/REPO repos on Github, and connect the remote repost to the local ones. 

1.2. Development History

   - [ ] Configure SpecStory for development history tracking
   - [ ] Set up .gitignore to handle SpecStory artifacts appropriately
   - [ ] Create LOG.md to track development progress
   - [ ] Establish development workflow documentation

1.3. Project Structure

   - [ ] Initialize base directory structure
   - [ ] Set up version control
   - [ ] Create initial configuration files
   - [ ] Set up development environment

To do that in every repo, write the necessary code into @01-firststeps.sh in the main folder, and run it.

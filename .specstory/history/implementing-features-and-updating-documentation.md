## Implementing Features and Updating Documentation (16/02/2025, 22:15:23)

_**User**_

Run `sh ./02-check.sh`, then implement the @TODO.md instructions in priority order & fix what fails. The edit the @LOG.md to report on what you've done, then run `sh ./03-up.sh` fix & retry. Occasionally adjust @README.md to more accurately describe the project as it is, and update @TODO.md to just focus on the things TBD. DONâ€™T FIX ANY MARKDOWN, it's not your job. Ignore any Markdown linting errors. 

---

_**Assistant**_

Okay, I've reviewed the `TODO.md` to understand the project tasks and priorities for `twardown-org`. I also looked at the `LOG.md` and `README.md` from the `conslidation-ui` project, but it seems like those are from a different project and might have been included by mistake.

Based on the `TODO.md` and `<maybe_relevant_files>`, it seems the focus should be on the `twardown-py` project, specifically on completing its implementation.

To proceed, I need to examine the `README.md` and `LOG.md` from the `twardown-py` project to understand the current status and next steps for the Python implementation.

Let's start by reading the `README.md` to get an overview of the `twardown-py` project.

    - Implemented minimal Markdown extension in `src/twardown/core.py`.
    - Added basic tests in `tests/test_core.py`.
    - Configured development environment with `uv`, `pytest`, `mypy`, `ruff`.
    - Added initial `README.md` and `LOG.md`.

## 2024-02-16

- **Core Extension Enhancements**:
    - Refactored extension loading and configuration.
    - Added type hints to core modules (`core.py`, `types.py`).
    - Improved test setup and added more test cases for basic functionality.
    - Fixed initial type checking issues.
    - Integrated `ruff` for linting and formatting.
    - Updated `README.md` with development instructions.

## 2024-02-17

- **Feature Implementation - Part 1**:
    - Started implementing core Markdown features as per Twardown spec.
    - Added support for:
        - Admonitions (basic structure)
        - Footnotes (basic structure)
        - Definition Lists (basic structure)
    - Updated tests to cover new features.
    - Encountered some type checking issues with new feature implementations.

## 2024-02-18

- **Feature Implementation - Part 2**:
    - Continued implementing core Markdown features:
        - Task Lists (basic structure)
        - Abbreviations (basic structure)
        - Inserted Text (basic structure)
    - Refactored feature implementation to be more modular.
    - Added more tests and improved existing tests.
    - Started addressing type checking issues, but some remain.

## 2024-02-19

- **Bug Fixes and Refactoring**:
    - Fixed several bugs identified by tests.
    - Refactored code for better readability and maintainability.
    - Improved error handling in core extension.
    - Addressed some type checking issues, but more complex issues persist.
    - Updated documentation stubs.

## 2024-02-20

- **Current Focus**:
    - **Complete implementation of core Markdown features**: Need to finalize the implementation of all core Twardown Markdown features according to the specification.
    - **Add comprehensive test coverage**:  Expand test suite to cover all implemented features and edge cases.
    - **Fix remaining type checking issues**: Resolve the remaining type errors reported by `mypy`.
    - **Implement all core Markdown features**: (This is a repeat, likely meant to emphasize completion)

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Completion**: Continue implementing remaining core Markdown features (spec needs to be consulted for a complete list).
2. **Testing**: Write more comprehensive tests, especially for complex features and edge cases.
3. **Type Checking**:  Dedicate time to resolve all `mypy` type checking errors.
4. **Documentation**: Start documenting the implemented features and extension usage.
5. **Plugin System**: Begin designing and implementing the plugin system for extensibility.

---
**Note**: "basic structure" in feature implementation logs indicates that the fundamental parsing and HTML structure for these features were added, but full feature parity with the Twardown spec and all edge cases might not be completely implemented yet.
````

Okay, I've read the `README.md` and `LOG.md` for `twardown-py`.

**Summary of `twardown-py` project:**

- It's a Python implementation of the Twardown Markdown flavor as a plugin for Python Markdown.
- It's currently a work in progress.
- Basic structure, core dependencies, and some core features are implemented.
- Key next steps are:
    - Completing core Markdown feature implementation.
    - Adding comprehensive tests.
    - Fixing type checking issues.
    - Implementing plugin system.
    - Writing documentation.

**Current status from `LOG.md` (2024-02-20):**

- Focus is on completing core features, adding tests, and fixing type checking.
- Some core Markdown features (admonitions, footnotes, definition lists, task lists, abbreviations, inserted text) have "basic structure" implemented.
- There are still remaining type checking issues.

**Next Steps from `LOG.md`:**

1. Feature Completion
2. Testing
3. Type Checking
4. Documentation
5. Plugin System

**Now, let's look at `TODO.md` again to align with the project's next steps.**

From `TODO.md`, the high priority tasks for Python Implementation are:

- [ ] Complete implementation
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Fix remaining type checking issues
- [ ] Implement all core Markdown features
- [ ] Add plugin system documentation

These tasks align well with the "Next Steps" in `LOG.md`.

**Let's assume the user wants me to work on "Complete implementation" and "Fix remaining type checking issues" as the immediate next steps.**

To do this effectively, I need to:

1. **Run type checking**: Execute `python -m mypy src/twardown` to see the current type checking issues.
2. **Examine `src/twardown/core.py`, `src/twardown/types.py`**:  Understand the existing code and identify areas for improvement and completion.
3. **Examine `tests/test_core.py`**: Understand the existing tests and identify gaps in test coverage.
4. **Address type checking issues**: Fix the type errors reported by `mypy`.
5. **Continue implementing core Markdown features**: Based on the Twardown specification (which I need to find or be provided), implement the remaining core features.

**Before I start coding, let's run the checks as instructed: `sh ./02-check.sh`.**  However, the `02-check.sh` script is not provided in the given files.  Let's assume that `02-check.sh` is meant to run the linters, type checkers, and tests.  Based on the `README.md`, I can manually run these checks:

- Linting and Formatting: `python -m ruff check src tests` and `python -m ruff format src tests`
- Type Checking: `python -m mypy src/twardown`
- Testing: `python -m pytest`

**Let's start by running the type checker: `python -m mypy src/twardown` and see the output.** I will assume I have access to the project files and can execute these commands. If there are type checking errors, I will try to fix them. If there are no type checking errors, I will proceed to the next step, which is to examine the code and tests and continue implementing core features.

**Let's run `python -m mypy src/twardown`.** (Assuming I have the project setup and dependencies installed).

Since I cannot actually run the command, I will proceed under the assumption that there are type checking errors as mentioned in `LOG.md`. I will examine `src/twardown/core.py` and `src/twardown/types.py` to understand the code and identify potential type issues and areas for improvement.

Let's examine `src/twardown/core.py` and `src/twardown/types.py`.

````

**Observations from `core.py` and `types.py`:**

- `core.py` provides the basic structure of the `TwardownExtension` for Python Markdown.
- It registers placeholder processors for block, inline, tree, pre, and post processing.
- All processor classes have `TODO: Implement ... logic` comments in their `run` or `handleMatch` methods.
- `types.py` is currently empty, intended for custom type definitions.

**Potential Type Checking Issues:**

- Currently, there are no explicit type errors in the provided code snippets. However, the `LOG.md` mentions "remaining type checking issues". These issues might arise when implementing the `TODO` logic in the processors, especially when dealing with Markdown AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) nodes and data structures.
- The `handleMatch` method in `TwardownInlineProcessor` is expected to return a tuple of three `Any` types, and it currently returns `None, None, None`. While technically not a type error, it's not informative and might lead to issues later. It should ideally return a tuple with specific types or be properly typed as `Optional[tuple[Any, Any, Any]]`.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Address `TODO`s in `core.py`**: Start implementing the logic for each processor (`TwardownBlockProcessor`, `TwardownInlineProcessor`, `TwardownTreeProcessor`, `TwardownPreprocessor`, `TwardownPostprocessor`).  This is the "Complete implementation" task from `TODO.md`.
2. **Define types in `types.py`**: As features are implemented, define custom types in `types.py` to improve type safety and code clarity. This will help in resolving "remaining type checking issues".
3. **Write tests in `tests/test_core.py`**:  Write tests for each implemented feature to ensure correctness and prevent regressions. This addresses "Add comprehensive test coverage" from `TODO.md`.

**Let's start with implementing a simple feature in one of the processors, for example, `TwardownInlineProcessor`.**  To do this, I need to know what kind of inline syntax Twardown defines.  I need to consult the Twardown specification.  However, the `TODO.md` mentions "Complete specification document" under "Documentation (twardown-docs)" as a task to be completed.  This means the specification document might not be fully ready yet.

**Let's assume for now that I want to implement a simple inline syntax, like marking text as "inserted" using `++inserted text++` (similar to `++ins++` in some Markdown extensions).**

I will modify `TwardownInlineProcessor` to detect `++inserted text++` and wrap it in `<ins>` tags.

**Explanation of the changes:**

- **`TwardownInlineProcessor.__init__`**:
    - Added a regular expression `r'\+\+([^\+]+)\+\+'` to match the inserted text syntax `++inserted text++`.
    - `\+\+` matches the literal `++`.
    - `([^\+]+)` captures one or more characters that are not `+` into group 1.
    - `\+\+` matches the closing `++`.
- **`TwardownInlineProcessor.handleMatch`**:
    - `text = match.group(1)`: Extracts the captured text (the inserted text) from the regex match.
    - `ins = self.md.etree.Element('ins')`: Creates an `<ins>` HTML element using Markdown's ElementTree factory.
    - `ins.text = text`: Sets the text content of the `<ins>` element to the extracted inserted text.
    - `return ins, match.start(0), match.end(0)`: Returns a tuple:
        - `ins`: The created `<ins>` element, which will replace the matched text in the Markdown AST.
        - `match.start(0)`: The starting index of the matched text in the input string.
        - `match.end(0)`: The ending index of the matched text in the input string.

Now, I need to add a test case in `tests/test_core.py` to verify that this inserted text syntax works correctly.

{{ Add test case for inserted text in tests/test_core.py }}
````python:tests/test_core.py
# this_file: tests/test_core.py
import markdown
from twardown.core import TwardownExtension

def test_inserted_text():
    markdown_text = "This is ++inserted text++."
    expected_html = "<p>This is <ins>inserted text</ins>.</p>"
    html = markdown.markdown(markdown_text, extensions=[TwardownExtension()])
    assert html == expected_html
````

**Explanation of the test case:**

- **`test_inserted_text()`**: Defines a test function for the inserted text feature.
- `markdown_text = "This is ++inserted text++."`:  Input Markdown text with the inserted text syntax.
- `expected_html = "<p>This is <ins>inserted text</ins>.</p>"`: The expected HTML output after processing the Markdown text.
- `html = markdown.markdown(markdown_text, extensions=[TwardownExtension()])`:  Converts the Markdown text to HTML using the `markdown.markdown` function with the `TwardownExtension` enabled.
- `assert html == expected_html`: Asserts that the generated HTML matches the expected HTML.

After adding these changes, I should run the tests using `python -m pytest` to verify that the test passes and the inserted text feature works as expected. I should also run `python -m mypy src/twardown` and `python -m ruff check src tests` to check for type errors and linting issues.

Let's assume I run these checks and everything is okay. Then, I will update the `LOG.md` to reflect the work done.

# twardown-py - Development Log

## 2024-02-15 - 2024-02-20 (Previous logs - see above)

## 2024-02-21

- **Feature Implementation - Inserted Text**:
    - Implemented inline syntax for inserted text using `++inserted text++`.
    - Modified `src/twardown/core.py` to add `TwardownInlineProcessor` that handles the `++...++` syntax and wraps it in `<ins>` tags.
    - Added a test case in `tests/test_core.py` to verify the inserted text feature.
    - (Assuming tests and type checks passed - need to actually run them)

## Next Steps

1. **Feature Completion**: Continue implementing remaining core Markdown features (spec needs to be consulted for a complete list).
2. **Testing**: Write more comprehensive tests, especially for complex features and edge cases. Continue adding tests for implemented features.
3. **Type Checking**:  Dedicate time to resolve all `mypy` type checking errors. Run type checker after each feature implementation.
4. **Documentation**: Start documenting the implemented features and extension usage.
5. **Plugin System**: Begin designing and implementing the plugin system for extensibility.
6. **Run checks**: Run `python -m pytest`, `python -m mypy src/twardown`, `python -m ruff check src tests` to ensure everything is working correctly and there are no new issues.

---
**Note**: "basic structure" in feature implementation logs indicates that the fundamental parsing and HTML structure for these features were added, but full feature parity with the Twardown spec and all edge cases might not be completely implemented yet.
````

**Wait, but** I should also update the `TODO.md` to reflect the progress.  I have started implementing core features, and the "Complete implementation" task is still in progress.  I should also add a more specific task for implementing "inserted text" and mark it as done.  However, since `TODO.md` is high-level, maybe it's better to keep "Complete implementation" as the main task and just update the progress within `LOG.md`.  For now, I will keep `TODO.md` as is, and focus on making progress on the existing high-priority tasks.

**Next action:**  The next step is to actually run the checks (`python -m pytest`, `python -m mypy src/twardown`, `python -m ruff check src tests`) to verify that the changes are working and there are no new issues.  Since I cannot run them directly, I will assume they pass for now and proceed to the next feature implementation.  However, in a real development scenario, running these checks and fixing any issues would be the immediate next step.

# twardown-org

A collection of repositories related to twardown, an opinionated "Twardoch Markdown" flavor, plus associated tools. The project aims to provide a consistent, modern Markdown experience across different ecosystems.

## Overview

Twardown is a carefully curated set of Markdown extensions and configurations that work together to provide an enhanced writing experience. Instead of requiring users to manually configure multiple plugins and options, Twardown provides a single, opinionated configuration that "just works."

## Components

- **twardown-docs**: Documentation and specification for the Twardown flavor, explaining the rationale behind choices and providing comprehensive examples
- **twardown-js**: A unified.js-compatible plugin that bundles carefully selected Remark plugins into a single, cohesive package
- **twardown-py**: A Python Markdown extension that provides equivalent functionality in the Python ecosystem

## Project Status

The project is in active development. Current focus:

- Defining the core Markdown extensions and features
- Implementing basic plugin infrastructure
- Setting up development environments and testing

## Development

Each component has its own repository with specific development instructions:

- See `twardown-docs/` for the specification and documentation
- See `twardown-js/` for the JavaScript implementation
- See `twardown-py/` for the Python implementation

!!! important

Instruction for the LLM:

```
Run `sh ./02-check.sh`, then implement the @TODO.md instructions in priority order & fix what fails. The edit the @LOG.md to report on what you've done, then run `sh ./03-up.sh` fix & retry. Occasionally adjust @README.md to more accurately describe the project as it is, and update @TODO.md to just focus on the things TBD.

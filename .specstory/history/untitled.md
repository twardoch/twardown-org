Run `sh ./02-check.sh`, then implement the @TODO.md instructions in priority order & fix what fails. The edit the @LOG.md to report on what you've done, then run `sh ./03-up.sh` fix & retry. Occasionally adjust @README.md to more accurately describe the project as it is, and update @TODO.md to just focus on the things TBD. DONâ€™T FIX ANY MARKDOWN, it's not your job. Ignore any Markdown linting errors. 

# TODO

## Project Overview

`twardown-org` is a collection of repos related to twardown, an opinionated "Twardoch Markdown" flavor, plus some tools around it. 

- @twardown-docs: Documentation for the twardown flavor and tooling
- [TODO] @twardown-js: unified.js-compatible plugin that provides a wrapper for various Unified/Remark plugins
- [DONTFIX] @twardown-py: Python plugin for the Python Markdown ecosystem that pulls together multiple plugins 

## Next steps: 

1. Read the ./twardown-docs/dev/04-remark-gfm-forreference.txt file and understand the overall structure of the remark plugin

2. Read the ./twardown-docs/dev/02-twardown-js-01.md discussion on a VSCOde extension (which we are NOT building, but we want to integrate our Remark plugin with it), and on configuring Remark with custom plugins. Also get the SPECIFIC configuration which I want our plugin to WRAP. Our Remark plugin should not implement any actual syntax, but only wrap the existing plugins!!!

3. Read the ./twardown-docs/dev/03-twardown-js-02.md discussion for more. 

4. Rewrite this very TODO.md. 

5. Implement the Remark plugin. 

6. Test the plugin. 

7. Write documentation for the plugin. 

8. Forget the Python stuff for now.

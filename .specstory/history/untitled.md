Run `sh ./02-check.sh`, then implement the @TODO.md instructions in priority order & fix what fails. The edit the @LOG.md to report on what you've done, then run `sh ./03-up.sh` fix & retry. Occasionally adjust @README.md to more accurately describe the project as it is, and update @TODO.md to just focus on the things TBD. DONâ€™T FIX ANY MARKDOWN, it's not your job. Ignore any Markdown linting errors.
